## This is a list of instruction on how to run the code. 


### STEPS:

1) There are 3 main code files here for the 3 different micro controlers. "projectargon.ino" is meant to be used on the particle argon, "projectpi.ino" is meant to be used on the first Raspberry Pi or the indoors raspberry pi and "projectpi2.ino" is meant to be used on the second outdoors raspberry pi. 

2) Adafruit_DHT.cpp and Adafruit_DHT.h are libraries that need to be used with the second raspberry pi "projectpi2.ino" code for the DHT 11 sensor. 

3) THe circuits are shown on the video of the Project demonstration. 

4) List of triggers used in IFTTT for communication will also be included in the Artefact file.
